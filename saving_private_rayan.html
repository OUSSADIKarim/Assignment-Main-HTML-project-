                <strong>Saving Private Ryan</strong> is a 1998 American epic war film directed by Steven Spielberg and
                written by Robert Rodat. Set during the Battle of Normandy in World War II, the film is known for its
                graphic portrayal of war, especially its depiction of the Omaha Beach assault during the Normandy
                landings. The film follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and his squad
                (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy
                Davies) as they search for a paratrooper, Private first class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), the last
                surviving brother of four, the three other brothers having been killed in action. The film was a
                co-production between DreamWorks Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Amblin Entertainment, and Mutual Film
                Company. DreamWorks distributed the film in North America while Paramount released the film
                internationally.
